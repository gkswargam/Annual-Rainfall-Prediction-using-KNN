In this project we have developed a statistical model using R which predicts annual rainfall for the state of Missouri using statistical learning technique KNN regression. The model is trained to predict accurately using the data set that has past 100 years’ rain fall data of Missouri and it’s 4 neighboring states. The dataset has 10 predictors and a response variable as precipitation.
